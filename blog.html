        <h3>1.what is the difference between local storage and session storage?</h3>

        <p><span class="spcial-char">=></span> SessionStorage is similar to localStorage; the difference is that while
            data in localStorage doesn't
            expire,
            data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends.</p>

        <h3>2.what is the difference between global scope and block scope?</h3>

        <p><span class="spcial-char">=></span>
            <b>Global scope:</b> The Javascript global scope is the context where everything in a Javascript program
            executes by default. This scope includes all variables, objects, and references that are not contained
            within a customized scope defined by a programmer. Global scope is the entire Javascript execution
            environment
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Block scope:</b> This scope restricts the variable that is declared inside a specific block, from access
            by the outside of the block. The let & const keyword facilitates the variables to be block scoped.
