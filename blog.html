        <h3>1.what is the difference between local storage and session storage?</h3>

        <p><span class="spcial-char">=></span> SessionStorage is similar to localStorage; the difference is that while
            data in localStorage doesn't
            expire,
            data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends.</p>

        <h3>2.what is the difference between global scope and block scope?</h3>

        <p><span class="spcial-char">=></span>
            <b>Global scope:</b> The Javascript global scope is the context where everything in a Javascript program
            executes by default. This scope includes all variables, objects, and references that are not contained
            within a customized scope defined by a programmer. Global scope is the entire Javascript execution
            environment
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            <b>Block scope:</b> This scope restricts the variable that is declared inside a specific block, from access
            by the outside of the block. The let & const keyword facilitates the variables to be block scoped.
        </p>

        <h3>3.how does the js event loop work?</h3>

        <p><span class="spcial-char">=></span>
            The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is
            empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which
            effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.
